# HOSHMANDEEP_Score

I created an application that displays the score of the two teams that will compete in any given game. The two squads were given the names Black Demons and Red Demons by me. Each team's score will be shown in the application. If we wish to manually raise or reduce the scores, we may use the + and - buttons. There is a score gain heading that shows how many points the team has acquired. This game is quite useful for someone who wants to play a game but has trouble calculating the points. With this application, an individual may easily calculate the scores.
