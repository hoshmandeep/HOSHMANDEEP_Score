# HOSHMANDEEP_Score

I created an application that displays the score of the two teams that will compete in any given game. The two squads were given the names Black Demons and Red Demons by me. Each team's score will be shown in the application. If we wish to manually raise or reduce the scores, we may use the + and - buttons. There is a score gain heading that shows how many points the team has acquired. This game is quite useful for someone who wants to play a game but has trouble calculating the points. With this application, an individual may easily calculate the scores.
This time I added some good stuff to the application. Last time in lab 2, I just created the design of the application like +, - buttons and scores 1, 2, 3, if someone wants to add the scores but we were unable to choose those buttons because it was just a design. In this lab, we can press the +, - buttons as well as we can see changes in the scores at the screen of the application. We can also choose 1, 2, 3 buttons this time in the application. I really enjoyed doing these changes.
